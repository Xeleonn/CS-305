Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
- Artemis Financial, a financial consulting firm specializing in savings, retirement, investments, and insurance plans, has engaged Global Rain, including myself, to create a web application to modernize their operations. The application will allow customers to upload files and access their accounts. Artemis Financial's main concern is ensuring the secure verification of data transfer during this process.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
- A key strength of this project was the generation of checksum values using various encryption algorithms to ensure data validation across different security protocols. Secure coding should be the top priority in any development project, regardless of its scope. Safeguarding both customer and company data, particularly in an era of increasing digital threats and piracy, must be a consideration at every stage of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
- I found reading and interpreting the vulnerability report generated by Maven dependency checks particularly challenging. There was a significant amount of information to process, much of which was new to me before this course. However, I believe that running dependency checks is crucial, especially for applications that heavily rely on frameworks and external APIs for data handling and manipulation.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
- My approach to enhancing the application's security involved utilizing multiple encryption algorithms. Different parts of the application require tailored security measures depending on the action being performed. For instance, certain algorithms are better suited for validating file data, while others are more effective for user credential authentication. Employing a multi-layered encryption and security strategy is a method I plan to continue using in future applications and projects.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- Functionally, I tested each component of the web application individually before verifying the integration of internal and external resources. After making any changes to the code, I ran additional vulnerability checks to ensure that no new errors were introduced.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- Documentation for the Spring framework, along with tutorials on generating and interpreting vulnerability reports, played a significant role in the development of this project. I find that reading documentation for a specific tool or programming language is particularly useful when working with an unfamiliar tool.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
- I would highlight the vulnerability reports, or more precisely, the documentation and interpretations I developed based on the findings of those reports. I believe that understanding security reports is a crucial aspect of web development, particularly from the perspective of future employers. Although I’m not yet fully confident in my ability to read and interpret these reports, I feel that this project has set me on the path to better understanding.
